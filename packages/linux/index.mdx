### Stage changes

 - Stage all changes in  `<file>`  for the next commit.
 
         git add <file>

 - Stage all changes in  `<directory>`  for the next commit.
 
         git add <directory>

- Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose
portions of a file to add to the next commit. 
This will present you with a chunk of changes and prompt you
for a command. 
Use y to stage the chunk, n to ignore the chunk,
 s to split it into smaller chunks,
  e to manually edit the chunk, and q to exit.

        git add -p
Examples:
  1. Add all files in the packages/linux directory

        git add packages/linux/*  

  2. Add all files ending with  .js  in the packages/linux directory

        git add packages/linux/*.js

### add ssh key
Requirements: github (or other service) account<br/>
Example:

- Create a new ssh key.Your email has to be the one that is at your account <br/>

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

```

- You are asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key" press Enter. 
  This accepts the default file location. the key's file is /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa

- You are asked to Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type new passphrase] (hind: press enter)

  If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.
