### Stage changes

         git add <file>

 - Stage all changes in  `<directory>`  for the next commit.
 
         git add <directory>

- Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose
portions of a file to add to the next commit. 
This will present you with a chunk of changes and prompt you
for a command. 

   Use **y** to stage the chunk, **n** to ignore the chunk,
 **s** to split it into smaller chunks,
 **e** to manually edit the chunk, and **q** to exit.
  
        git add -p

Examples:

  1.  Add all files in the packages/linux directory

        git add packages/linux/*    

  2. Add all files ending with  .js  in the packages/linux directory

        git add packages/linux/*.js 

### diff 

### commit

### log

### ignore

### Create repo on github

### add ssh key
Requirements: github (or other service) account<br/>

- Create a new ssh key.Your email has to be the one that is at your account <br/>

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

```

- You are asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key" press Enter. 
  This accepts the default file location. the key's file is /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa

- You are asked to Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type new passphrase] (hind: press enter)

- You are asked to Enter same passphrase again: [One more time for luck] (hind: press enter )

- Copy ssh key <br/>

  ```
  cat .ssh/id.pub
  
  ```
- Go to your GitHub account -> the Settings ->Personal Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key
  and press Ctrl+Shift+V -> Add SSH key

- Start the ssh-agent in the background.<br/>
  ```
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  
  ```

- Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.  <br/>
  ```
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```       
  If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

### add remote

### push 
Command : 
  ```
  git push 

  ```
Examples:
- Push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.

  ```
  git push branch_name

  ``` 
### pull / fetch
 Command : 
  ```
  git pull 

  ```
  Is used to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server.<br/>
  This means that pull not only downloads new data but it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.<br/>
 Command : 
  ```
  git fetch 

  ```
  Downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files.
  Examples:
- Fetch all Git branches
  ```
  git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | while read remote; do git branch --track "${remote#origin/}" "$remote"; done
  git fetch --all
  git pull --all

  ```
### branch
To create and checkout a new branch 

        git checkout -b new_branch_name

### stash

### merge
To merge from another branch


        git merge another_branch_name


### resolve conflicts


### git move
command: 

        git mv <source> <destination>

* force renaming or moving of a file even if the target exists

        git mv -f ...

* Skip move or rename actions which would lead to an error condition. An error happens when a source is neither existing nor controlled by Git, or when it would overwrite an existing file unless -f is given.

        git mv -k ...


* Do nothing; only show what would happen

        git mv -n <source> <destination>

* Report the names of files as they are moved.

        git mv -v <source> <destination>
     


### Take code back in time (reset)
Examples:
- Reset local repository branch to be just like remote repository
  ```
  git fetch origin
  git reset --hard origin/master

  ```
