## Modules 

As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called “modules”. A module usually contains a class or a library of functions.
A module is just a file. One script is one module. 

Modules can load each other and use special directives ```export``` and ```import``` to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

*  *export* keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.


*  *import* allows to import functionality from other modules.



### Examples using import and export 

* *simple use*

    if we have a file ```helloWorld.js``` exporting a function: 
    
```js
{
  alert (`Hello, $ {user}!`);
}
```            

    then another file may import and use it:
    
```js
import {helloWorld} from './helloWorld.js'; 
alert(helloWorld); //function..
helloWorld('Bob'); // Hello Bob!
```
