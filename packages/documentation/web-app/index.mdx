## Web app parts

### backend
The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients,
 and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. 
 The back-end also includes the database, 
 which will persistently store all of the data for the application. 

 The back-end includes three major parts:

 1. The server. This is the computer that receives requests.
 2. The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.
 3. The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.

- **clients** : The clients are anything that send requests to the back-end. They are often browsers that make requests for the HTML and JavaScript code that they will execute to display websites to the end user
- **server** : is simply a computer that listens for incoming requests

#### models
‘Models’ are higher-order constructors that take a schema and create an instance of a document equivalent to records in a relational database.
#### queries

#### mutations

#### validations

#### controllers

*remobe*<Controllers are functions called by routes. They get passed a request, perform the business logic, execute queries and mutations on the database and return a response.>

#### api routes

A route is an endpoint that relates an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) on a URL path with the corresponding controller.

##### HTTP request methods

HTTP defines a set of *** request methods *** to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

*     GET

 The ```GET``` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.


*     POST

    The ```POST``` method is used to submit (create) an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.


*     PUT

    The ```PUT``` method replaces (update) all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.


*     DELETE

    The ```DELETE``` method deletes the specified resource.

##### Create a new route and relate it to a controller (using the express.js framework)

To create a new route we call the *route()* method, defining the path as in the following example:

    router.route(`/api/songs`)

inside the method, we use a request method (e.g. a **get** request) which calls the main function of the controller

example: 

    .get(
         search
    )

### Google Puppeteer

#### What is Puppeteer?

Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

#### What can I do with Puppeteer?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

* Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.

* Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).

* Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.

* Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.

* Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.

* Test Chrome Extensions.

#### Examples 

To use Puppeteer in your project, run:
    npm i puppeteer
 
Save file as example.js:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.screenshot({path: 'example.png'});

  await browser.close();
})(); ```
