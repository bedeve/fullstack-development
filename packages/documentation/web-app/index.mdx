## Web app parts

### backend
The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients,
 and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. 
 The back-end also includes the database, 
 which will persistently store all of the data for the application. 

 The back-end includes three major parts:

 1. The server. This is the computer that receives requests.
 2. The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.
 3. The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.

- **clients** : are anything that send requests to the back-end. They are often browsers that make requests for the HTML and JavaScript code that they will execute to display websites to the end user

#### models
Models are higher-order constructors that take a schema and create an instance of a document equivalent to records in a relational database.
