## Web app parts

### backend
Using model driven development

#### models
Model driven development is way to architect applications.

#### queries

#### mutations

#### validations

#### controllers

Controllers are functions called by routes. They get passed a request, perform the business logic, execute queries and mutations on the database and return a response.

#### api routes

A route is an endpoint that connects a method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), a URL  path/pattern and the controller.

##### HTTP request methods

HTTP defines a set of *** request methods *** to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

*     GET

 The ```GET``` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.


*     POST

    The ```POST``` method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.


*     PUT

    The ```PUT``` method replaces (update) all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.


*     DELETE

    The ```DELETE``` method deletes the specified resource.

##### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that refers to a resource. The most common are URLs, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web.

##### Create a new route and relate it to a controller (using the express.js framework)

To create a new route we call the *route* method, defining the path as in the following example:

    router.route(`/api/songs`)

inside the method, we use a request method (e.g. a **get** request) in which which then calls the main function of the controller

example: 

    .get(
         search
        
    )
