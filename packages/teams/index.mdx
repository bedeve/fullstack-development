### Screenshot/Screencast
##TODO Style the instructions for Screenshot and add installation instructions for Screenshot/Record Desktop cinnamon applet https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/41

Quickly take a screenshot of the desktop, a window, or an area at any time using these global keyboard shortcuts:

Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of the desktop.

Alt+Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of a window.

Shift+Prt Scrn to take a screenshot of an area you select.

When you use a keyboard shortcut, the image is automatically saved in your Pictures folder in your home folder with a file name that begins with Screenshot and includes the date and time it was taken.
